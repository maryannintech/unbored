# UnBored

UnBored is a mini project I made to practice my JavaScript, CSS skills and learn about APIs (Application Programming Interface). It is a random activity generator used when someone is bored and want to do something, this program will suggests something based on the type of activity the user clicked with how many participants it requires, though it is up to the user if she/he/they want to follow it. This is the first time I used an API and with the implementation of [Bored API](https://www.boredapi.com/) this project is made functional.
